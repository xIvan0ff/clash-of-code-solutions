# Description:
# Over the centuries a language evolves, and not only do words appear or disappear, but some letters become more used or on the contrary less used.
# In order to be able to quickly analyze many texts, we want to develop a program that calculates how many times a given letter is present in a text.

# Input:
# Line 1: A character C that will be searched for
# Line 2: An integer N
# Next N lines: a string with length len

# Output:
# the number of times that C appears in the text

# 52 CHARACTERS

i=input
s=i()
i(sum(i().count(s)for _ in'_'*int(i())))
